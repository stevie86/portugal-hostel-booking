# Product Description

## Why This Project Exists
This project aims to create a user-friendly booking platform specifically designed for hostels and small rentals across Portugal, starting with Lisbon and expanding to major cities and regions nationwide. The platform addresses the growing demand for affordable, authentic accommodation options throughout Portugal, providing both travelers and property owners with a streamlined booking experience.

## Problems It Solves
- **For Travelers**: Difficulty finding and booking affordable, unique accommodations across Portugal without dealing with large corporate platforms that prioritize chain hotels.
- **For Property Owners**: Lack of affordable marketing and booking management tools tailored for small hostels and independent rentals nationwide.
- **Market Gap**: Current platforms are either too generic or too expensive for small operators, leaving a niche for a specialized, Portugal-focused solution.

## How It Should Work
1. **User Registration**: Travelers and hosts can create accounts with basic information.
2. **Property Listing**: Hosts can list their properties with photos, descriptions, amenities, and pricing across Portuguese cities.
3. **Search & Discovery**: Travelers can search by location, dates, price range, and property type with regional filters.
4. **Booking Process**: Seamless booking with instant confirmation, payment processing, and communication tools.
5. **Management Dashboard**: Hosts get tools to manage bookings, availability, and property information.
6. **Review System**: Both parties can leave reviews to build trust in the community.

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clean, mobile-first design that works seamlessly across devices.
- **Fast Performance**: Quick loading times and responsive interactions.
- **Trust & Transparency**: Clear pricing, honest reviews, and direct communication between users.
- **Local Focus**: Highlight Portugal's unique cities, regions, culture, and hidden gems.
