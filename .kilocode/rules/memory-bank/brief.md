Portugal Hostel Booking Platform â€“ Project Description

## Overview
A niche booking platform focused on hostels across Portugal, starting with one pilot hostel listing 5 rooms in Lisbon and scaling to 15+ properties nationwide. The platform aims to provide a fair, curated alternative to large OTAs by offering lower fees, transparency, and a better experience for hostel owners and guests throughout Portugal's major cities and regions.

## Objectives
- Enable guests to search, view, and request hostel room bookings online across Portugal.
- Provide hostel owners with a simple dashboard to manage rooms and confirm bookings.
- Support internationalisation (English, Portuguese, German).
- Build a scalable foundation ready for payments, channel management, and nationwide expansion.

## Key Features (MVP)
- Hostel/room search with filters, location-based search, and details across Portuguese cities.
- Booking request flow with manual confirmation by hostel owners.
- Room and price management in a lightweight host dashboard.
- Internationalisation-ready UI.
- SQLite database for prototyping with migration path to Postgres.

## Technologies
- Next.js (App Router) for the frontend and API.
- Prisma ORM with SQLite (development) and Postgres (later).
- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- next-intl for multi-language support.
- GitHub Codespaces + Devcontainers for development.
- Vercel for preview deployments.

## Significance
This project provides hostel owners across Portugal with a cost-effective and user-friendly booking alternative, while giving travellers a curated selection of authentic local hostels in major cities and regions. The system is designed for rapid prototyping today and scalable nationwide growth tomorrow.
