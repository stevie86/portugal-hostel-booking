# Payment Gateway Abstraction Layer Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a unified payment service that supports MB WAY, Multibanco, and credit card payments for the Portugal Hostel Booking platform MVP.

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **PaymentProvider (Abstract Base Class)**
   - Defines common interface for all payment providers
   - Handles common functionality like validation, logging
   - Provides extensible framework for new payment methods

2. **Concrete Providers**
   - **MBWayProvider**: Handles MB WAY mobile payments
   - **MultibancoProvider**: Handles Multibanco banking network payments
   - **CreditCardProvider**: Handles credit/debit card payments

3. **PaymentService (Orchestrator)**
   - Unified interface for the application
   - Routes requests to appropriate provider
   - Manages transaction lifecycle
   - Handles error recovery and retries

4. **Integration Points**
   - **BookingService**: Initiates payments for bookings
   - **Database**: Stores payment records and transaction data
   - **NotificationService**: Sends payment status updates

## Database Schema Updates

### PaymentType Enum
Add new payment types to support Portuguese methods:
```prisma
enum PaymentType {
  CREDIT_CARD
  DEBIT_CARD
  PAYPAL
  BANK_TRANSFER
  MB_WAY          // New
  MULTIBANCO      // New
}
```

### PaymentMethod Model
Extend to support provider-specific configuration:
```prisma
model PaymentMethod {
  id          String @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  type        PaymentType
  isActive    Boolean @default(true)
  config      Json?  // Provider-specific configuration
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  payments Payment[]
}
```

## Service Architecture

### PaymentProvider Interface
```typescript
interface PaymentProvider {
  processPayment(request: PaymentRequest): Promise<PaymentResult>
  refundPayment(transactionId: string, amount: number): Promise<RefundResult>
  validatePaymentMethod(details: PaymentMethodDetails): Promise<ValidationResult>
  getPaymentStatus(transactionId: string): Promise<PaymentStatus>
}
```

### Payment Flow
1. **Initiation**: BookingService calls PaymentService.processPayment()
2. **Routing**: PaymentService selects appropriate provider based on payment type
3. **Processing**: Provider handles payment with external service
4. **Recording**: Payment record created in database
5. **Notification**: Status updates sent to user and host
6. **Completion**: Booking status updated based on payment result

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Error Types
- **PaymentError**: Generic payment processing errors
- **ValidationError**: Invalid payment data
- **ProviderError**: External provider failures
- **TimeoutError**: Payment processing timeouts
- **InsufficientFundsError**: Specific to card payments

### Retry Strategy
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Maximum retry attempts: 3
- Circuit breaker pattern for provider failures
- Fallback to alternative payment methods when possible

### Transaction Tracking
- Unique transaction IDs across all providers
- Comprehensive logging of all payment attempts
- Audit trail for compliance and debugging
- Real-time status monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- PCI DSS compliance for card payments
- Encryption of sensitive payment data
- Secure tokenization of payment methods
- No storage of full card details

### Authentication
- Provider API key management
- Secure credential storage
- Request signing for API calls

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Update database schema
- Create abstract PaymentProvider class
- Implement basic PaymentService orchestrator
- Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 2: Provider Implementations
- Implement MBWayProvider (mock for MVP)
- Implement MultibancoProvider (mock for MVP)
- Implement CreditCardProvider (Stripe integration)
- Add provider-specific validation

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
- Integrate with BookingService
- Add payment status webhooks
- Implement notification system
- Create comprehensive test suite

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Implement rate limiting
- Add payment analytics
- Performance optimization

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual provider implementations
- PaymentService orchestration logic
- Error handling scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end payment flows
- Database transaction integrity
- External provider API mocking
- Notification system integration

### Load Testing
- Concurrent payment processing
- High-volume transaction handling
- System performance under load

## Future Extensibility

### New Payment Methods
- Plugin architecture for easy addition
- Configuration-driven provider setup
- Standardized interface for all providers

### Advanced Features
- Subscription payments
- Partial refunds
- Payment plans
- Multi-currency support

## Dependencies

### External Services
- **Stripe**: Credit card processing
- **MB WAY API**: Mobile payment processing
- **Multibanco API**: Banking network integration

### Internal Dependencies
- **Prisma**: Database operations
- **BookingService**: Payment initiation
- **NotificationService**: Status updates
- **AuditService**: Transaction logging

## Success Metrics
