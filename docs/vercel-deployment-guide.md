## 4. Handling PostCSS Configuration Issue for Tailwind v4 Compatibility

The project currently has a PostCSS configuration issue preventing successful builds on Vercel due to Tailwind v4 compatibility. Follow these steps to resolve it:

### Identify the Issue
The error typically manifests as:
```
Module build failed: Error: PostCSS plugin tailwindcss requires PostCSS 8.
```

### Resolution Steps

1. **Update PostCSS Configuration**
   - Open [`postcss.config.js`](postcss.config.js)
   - Ensure it exports the correct configuration:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       plugins: {
         tailwindcss: {},
         autoprefixer: {},
       },
     }
     ```

2. **Verify Tailwind Configuration**
   - Check [`tailwind.config.js`](tailwind.config.js) for v4 compatibility
   - Ensure content paths are correctly set:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       content: [
         './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
         './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
         './lib/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
       ],
       theme: {
         extend: {},
       },
       plugins: [],
     }
     ```

3. **Update Package Dependencies**
   - Ensure `package.json` has compatible versions:
     ```json
     {
       "tailwindcss": "^3.4.0",
       "postcss": "^8.4.0",
       "autoprefixer": "^10.4.0"
     }
     ```
   - Run `npm update` to install latest compatible versions

4. **Test Locally**
   - Run `npm run build` to verify the fix
   - Check for any remaining PostCSS or Tailwind errors

5. **Commit and Deploy**
   - Commit the configuration changes
   - Push to the target branch
   - Vercel will automatically redeploy with the fixes

### Alternative: Downgrade to Tailwind v3
If v4 compatibility issues persist:
1. Install Tailwind v3: `npm install tailwindcss@^3.4.0`
2. Update configuration files accordingly
3. Test and redeploy

## 5. Deploying from Appropriate Branches
